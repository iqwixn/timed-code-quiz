# Description

I needed to create a timed multiple choice quiz that could store high scores using HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Acceptance Criteria

Clicking the start button starts the quiz and the timer.
Clicking the correct answer prompts the next question.
Clicking the incorrect answer subtracts time from the timer.
When all questions are answered or the timer hits zero, the game ends.
Once the game ends you can input your initials and see the high score.


# Work Completed

Created a start button that begins the quiz and timer.
Created questions for the quiz to cycle through.
Created four possible answers for each question.
Getting a question correct prompted the next question in the quiz.
Getting the question incorrect subtracts 5 seconds from the timer.
